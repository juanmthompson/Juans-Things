    <p>
        I’m a materialistic person. I love holding onto all of my physical possessions whether it’s my first Michigan game-day ticket, or my favorite T-Shirt. 
        I don't agree with critics of materialistic people because to me, all of my things are extensions of myself and my identity.</br>This website serves as a 
        catalog for all of my favorite things I’ve collected over time. Descriptions of my things range from stories of how I came across them to the material 
        they’re made of. I also rank my things with dollar values because although I love most things I collect, some of my things have greater value to me than 
        others.</br>I hope you enjoy my things!
