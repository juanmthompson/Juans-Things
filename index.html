				Left hinge slightly broken, otherwise in good condition. The case is a new 
				replacement because I slightly broke the old case too. I bought these glasses 
				in 2019 and since then they’ve been my traveling companion on any sunny day 
				adventure. I fully expect to lose these glasses one day.

			<h1>Made In DC Sticker</h1>
			<h2>$0.50</h2>
			<h3>1”x1”</h3>
			<p>
				This sticker is handed out by small businesses in DC. It reminds me of my 
				favorite coffee shop at home: Compass Coffee. I only have one now, but 
				I know where to get more. You can have it for 50 cents.

			<h1>Mama's Bracelet</h1>
			<h2>Priceless</h2>
			<p>
				I love this bracelet. Each stone/charm on the bracelet reminds my mom of me and 
				my two siblings. I think the bracelet looks cool and it reminds me of my mom.

			<h1>Leather Bracelet</h1>
			<h2>$15</h2>

				The clamp is a weak magnet, so the bracelet is undone easily.

			<h1>4 Oceans Bracelet</h1>
			<h2>$50</h2>
			<p>
				This bracelet has been through a lot. Broken twice, and lost beads each 
				time. The beads are in funny spots now because of the knots I made to fix the 
				bracelet up.

			<h1>Mizuno Catcher's Mitt</h1>
			<h2>$70</h2>
			<p>
				I used to be a baseball catcher up until high school. I was never that good, 
				but this mitt means a lot to me because it reminds me of my dad.
